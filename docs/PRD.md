# English Buddy — Product Requirements Document
## MVP for Sisense Demo — April 2026

---

## Overview

English Buddy is an AI-powered English conversation app for kids (ages 8-12) who are learning English as a second language. Each session starts with a visual question (3 image cards), the kid picks one, and a short AI conversation follows about that topic.

The app is the VEHICLE for the Sisense demo. The real deliverable is showing how Sisense provides analytics for a vibe-coded product.

## Core User Flow

```
Kid opens app
  → Enters name (no auth, just a name — persisted in localStorage)
  → Sees: Question + 3 image/illustration cards
  → Example: "What's your favorite food?" → [Pizza] [Ice Cream] [Hamburger]
  → Option to [Skip] if they don't like the question
  
Kid picks a card
  → Chat window opens with AI greeting related to the topic
  → AI speaks in simple English (A1-A2 level)
  → AI asks follow-up questions, teaches vocabulary
  → Kid types or selects from suggested responses
  
After a few exchanges (3-5 messages)
  → "Ask me something else!" button appears
  → New question + 3 cards
  → Repeat
  
Session ends
  → Kid closes tab (no explicit end)
  → Or after X questions answered
```

## Question System

### Question Config (server-side)
Each question has:
- `id`: unique identifier
- `text`: the question in English ("What's your favorite food?")
- `options`: array of 3 choices, each with:
  - `label`: text ("Pizza")
  - `image`: URL or emoji/illustration reference
- `topic_tag`: for analytics ("food", "animals", "sports", "family")
- `difficulty`: 1-3 (vocabulary level)
- `sequence_group`: for A/B testing ("sequence_A", "sequence_B")

### A/B Testing
- Two (or more) question sequences configured on server
- New users randomly assigned to a sequence
- Same user always gets the same sequence
- Sisense shows: which sequence retains better

### Example Questions (MVP — 6 total, 2 sequences of 3)

**Sequence A:**
1. "What's your favorite animal?" → [Dog] [Cat] [Fish]
2. "What do you like to eat?" → [Pizza] [Ice Cream] [Pasta]
3. "What do you do after school?" → [Play] [Read] [Watch TV]

**Sequence B:**
1. "What do you like to eat?" → [Pizza] [Ice Cream] [Pasta]
2. "What's your favorite game?" → [Soccer] [Video Games] [Hide and Seek]
3. "Who is your best friend?" → [A boy] [A girl] [My pet]

## AI Tutor Behavior

### System Prompt Principles
- Speak in very simple English (A1-A2 CEFR level)
- Short sentences (5-8 words max)
- Use the topic the kid selected
- Ask one question at a time
- When the kid makes a grammar mistake, gently correct: "Great! We say 'I like pizza' — you're doing awesome!"
- Introduce 1-2 new vocabulary words per conversation
- Be encouraging and fun
- Use emojis sparingly

### Example Conversation
```
AI: "You like pizza! Me too! 🍕 What is your favorite pizza?"
Kid: "i like pizza cheez"
AI: "Cheese pizza! Yummy! 🧀 We say 'cheese pizza'. Do you like it with tomato sauce?"
Kid: "yes"
AI: "Great! Pizza with cheese and tomato sauce is called 'Margherita'. Can you say 'Margherita pizza'?"
```

## Sisense Dashboard (The Deliverable)

### Charts to Build

1. **Retention Curve** — Day 1/3/7/14/30 retention by cohort
   - X: days since signup, Y: % of users returning
   - Split by sequence_group (A vs B)

2. **Session Funnel**
   - Opened app → Started conversation → 3+ messages → Completed 2+ topics → Returned next day
   - Shows where kids drop off

3. **A/B Test Results**
   - Sequence A vs B: retention at day 3 and day 7
   - Sequence A vs B: avg messages per session
   - Sequence A vs B: avg topics per session

4. **Topic Engagement**
   - Bar chart: messages per topic (which topics generate most conversation)
   - Skip rate per question (which questions kids skip)

5. **Vocabulary Growth**
   - Words introduced over time (cumulative)
   - Most common words taught

## Synthetic Data Generator

A Node.js script that creates realistic fake data:
- 200 users over 30 days
- Split 50/50 into sequence_A and sequence_B
- Realistic retention: ~60% day 1, ~30% day 3, ~15% day 7, ~5% day 14
- Sequence B retains slightly better (to show A/B result)
- 2-5 sessions per retained user
- 1-4 topics per session
- 3-8 messages per conversation
- Some questions get skipped more than others

## Tech Stack

| Component | Tech | Hosting |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Frontend | Next.js + Tailwind CSS | Netlify |
| Backend/API | Node.js + Express + TypeScript | Railway |
| AI | Claude API (Anthropic SDK) | API calls |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Railway |
| Analytics | Sisense Compose SDK + MCP Server | Sisense Cloud (trial) |
| Design | Tailwind (or Google Stitch if viable) | — |

## What We DON'T Build (out of scope)

- User authentication (just a name in localStorage)
- Real speech/audio (text only for MVP)
- Progress tracking UI for the kid
- Parent account / login
- Mobile app (web only)
- Real A/B testing framework (just two hardcoded sequences)
- Production error handling
- Real vocabulary tracking (synthetic data covers this)

---
